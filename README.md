# Collaborative Study Platform

### The application is designed to help users organize group work and make collaboration more efficient. It allows students to create and join groups, manage members, share useful resources (links and files), create tasks with deadlines, and track their progress.


## Architecture Overview

### 1. Frontend (JavaFX Client)

- Provides the user interface

- Handles user interactions

- Sends HTTP requests to the backend

- Maintains a WebSocket connection for real-time notifications

### 2. Backend (Spring Boot REST API + WebSocket)

- KOLAY

### 3. Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

- Stores data: Users, Groups, Tasks, Memberships, Resources, Activity Log

- Defines relationships between tables
